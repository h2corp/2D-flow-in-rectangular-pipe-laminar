    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to set the CFD simulation up. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest in the end of the tutorial, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **2D Laminar flow in a rectangular pipe** are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">OpenFoam/run/tutorials</span>. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **2D Laminar Flow in a rectangular pipe** the tutorial of **2D over an airfoil** located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">OpenFoam/run/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D</span> is used. The reason behind choosing this tutorial for the current problem is that it is setup to simulate a 2D, steady state and incompressible flow. Furthermore, majority of the required boundary conditions for the current tutorial are similar to the required boundary conditions for our problem of interest. Hence, using the previously developed OpenFoam configuration files for the tutorial, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development can be done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the classical problem of a two dimensional flow in a rectangular pipe is that the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fvSchemes</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\system</span> folder. To set the solver to be steady users define <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">steadyState</span> for the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">ddtSchemes</span> and the rest of the settings will remain unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         steadyState;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time the Transient model should be chosen in this step. Various available time schemes along with other implementable option within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fvSchemes</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current problem the focus is to investigate laminar flow evolution inside the pipe and formation/effects of the laminar boundary layer at the pipe's walls as a uniform flow enter a vertical rectangular pipe. The appropriate model for this problem is set in a dictionary file called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">RASPropertise</span> (RAS stands for Reynolds Averages Stress) located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant</span> folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "RASModel        laminar;\n",

    "turbulence      off;\n",
    "\n",
    "printCoeffs     off;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the critical Reynolds number, based on the paper by Osborn Reynolds is 2300, when the regime of the flow transitions from laminar to turbulent. In case studies with Reynolds number higher than the corresponding critical values the appropriate turbulence model should be selected at this step. Various available turbulence models along with other options within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">RASPropertise</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/turbulence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainties in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">transportPropertise</span> located in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant</span> folder. In this file the material is set to be <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Newtonian</span> fluid with a defined kinematic viscosity nu ($\\nu$). It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 0.01;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the pipe's width is 0.1 [m] and user will define a unit constant uniform velocity (1 [m/s]), the value of nu ($\\nu$) will be defined as the inverse of Reynolds number. Therefore, changing this value would set the nominal Reynolds number of the flow based on the pipe's width ( Re=10 in this case. ). For other cases users should define the working fluid via this process. Various available transport models along with other options within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">transportPropertise</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">boundary</span> file located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant\\polyMesh</span>. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize it, the boundary file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">U</span> and pressure <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">p</span>, at these boundaries are set in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">U</span> and <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">p</span> files located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0</span> folder located in the working directory respectively.

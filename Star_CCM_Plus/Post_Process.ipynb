    "# CFD Results Post-Process and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final step for the development of a CFD simulation for a problem of interest is to process and examine the validity of the obtained numerical results (a.k.a post-processing and validation step). These steps requires an in-depth engineering knowledge about the fundamentals of the physical problem of interest. Thus, the value of investing time in understanding the fundamental physics of the flow, once again is highlighted here. This process is done starting from general inspection on CFD simulation results and ends with more detail validation process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first general rule of thumb to check the convergence of a CFD simulation is to visualize the residuals of the key flow variables, such as continuity, momentum, velocity and etc.. In STAR-CCM+ once user starts to run the simulation, the residual values for the relative variables, based on the choices of models, are visualized in the solver window. Furthermore, users can manage details of the plotted residuals or add other residuals to be visualized via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Plots/Residuals</span>.\n",

    "Fig.1 - Residuals of continuity and momentum in x-direction for simulation of flow in a rectangular pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 1 visualizes the residual values of continuity and momentum in x-direction versus the number of iterations. The general decreasing trend of the residual values confirm that the numerical solution of the conservation/governing equations are converging to specific final values. Usually the residual for the continuity decreases with the slower rate compared to other residual values. Therefore, a continuity residual of 1E-3, is the first necessary, but not sufficient, general criteria to confirm the convergence of the CFD simulation. In this case, this criteria is reached after about 40 iterations and after about 100 iterations the continuity residuals reached value of 1E-6, which is a solid confirmation of CFD simulation convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also define criteria to stop the iteration process once the desired criteria is met during the iteration process. These settings are available at via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Stopping Criteria\\ [right click]</span> path. In the current case study two criteria was set to stop the simulations: 1- Reaching a specific number of iterations via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Stopping Criteria\\Maximum Steps</span> of 1000 OR 2- Reaching a specific continuity residual value via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Stopping Criteria\\Continuity Criterion</span> of 1E-6. For the case of Re=10 the latter criterion was reach first and iterations were stopped after about 100 iterations as shown in Fig. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to visualize dimensionless form of the important variables within the CFD domain. This visualization step can be problem specific and should be performed over an adequate plane of choice. For most of the problems contour of normalized velocity or pressure, over a horizontal or vertical plane at the center of the CFD domain, is a good start point. The path to define an adequate plane such as planes or lines is <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Derived Parts/ [right click]</span>. With this path a user can define various type of probes to visualize the obtained numerical results over them. However, for the current problem since the entire domain is two dimensional and planar, it would make the entire domain the best candidate for the post-processing plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "User should now define the normalized variable of interest that needs to be visualized. The normalized streamwise velocity by the inlet velocity can be defined using <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Tools/Field Functions/ [[right click]/New/Scalar</span>. This path will define a User Field Function. User can name the variable in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Function Name</span> (i.e. Ux/U0) and put the required formula for the variable of interest with correct syntax under <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Definition</span> (i.e. $${Velocity}[0]/1). This will calculate the normalized streamwise velocity with free stream velocity of $1 \\frac{m}{s}$ within entire CFD domain. It order to visualize the defined normalized flow field variable in the previous step users should use <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Scenes/Scalar Scene 1/Displayers/Scalar 1/Scalar Field</span> and choose the Ux/U0.\n",

    "\n",
    "As shown in this Fig. 2, the flow enters the domain with normalized velocity of 1. Due to the imposed no slip boundary conditions on the pipe's walls, the velocity instantly decrease to zero at this region. The extreme change of momentum within the vertical direction creates a region at the entrance of the pipe, where the flow evolves in the streamwise direction. This specific length is referred to as the entrance length (discussed earlier in Physics section). After the entrance length the velocity profile becomes fully developed and holds it's shape to the end of the channel.\n",
    "It should also be highlighted that this velocity contour is smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After performing the general post-processing steps, the user need to perform more detail oriented post-processing to confirm the validity of the CFD simulation. This stage can be a state-of-the-art. Comparing the numerical results against the theory (discussed earlier) or any other available experimental results is the final stage of post-processing. It is extremely important to calculate the correct corresponding numerical variables and compare them against the experimental or other numerical data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to visualize the evolution of the velocity along the pipe user should look at the normalized streamwise velocity profiles with the inlet velocity at different stations downstream the pipe. Each station is defined as a vertical line probe at different distances downstream the pipe. User can use the path of <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Derived Parts/ [right click]/New Part/Probe/Line</span> to create the start and end point of each probe line station as shown in the following table, where `W` is the width of the rectangular pipe and `x` is the multiplier to define the distance downstream the inlet:\n",

    "|---|---\n",
    "|x*w|-0.05\n",

    "|x(1)|y(1)|\n",
    "|---|---\n",
    "|x*w|+0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `x` values are chosen to be 0.1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 5, 10 and 50. These `x` values will help users to visualize the evolution of the velocity field within entrance length and across the pipe toward it's end. Furthermore, it reveals the value of the numerically predicted entrance length. It should be noted the first four `x` values are chosen based on the prior experimental approximation of the entrance length as a function of Reynolds number. Therefore, for cases with different Reynolds number, these multiplier values should be redefined. Fig. 3-1 visualizes the position of each created probe line along the zoom-in view of rectangular pipe length.\n",

    "Fig.3-2 - Evolution of the streamwise velocity along the pipe at various downstream stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3-2 visualizes the numerically predicted streamwise velocity profiles along the pipe at 0.1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 5, 10 and 50 pipe's width downstream the inlet. Right after the pipe entrance, $ 0.1 * w = 0.01 [m]$ downstream the inlet, velocity profile is shown with red dots. This profile has a skewed bell shape and is not even close to the discussed parabolic velocity profile in the Physics section! There is also a sharp edge at about Y=0.01 [m] that seems to be a numerical error in the calculated velocity profile at this specific point within the CFD domain. Moving further downstream, at $0.5*w=0.05 [m]$ downstream the inlet, velocity profiles starts to get a parabolic shape as shown by red dots in Fig. 3-2. This evolution continues to happen until the 0.9w station downstream the inlet. After this station the velocity profile gets fully developed and does not evolve anymore. Therefore the plotted velocity profiles fall right on top of each other at further downstream stations. Hence, user can conclude that these numerical results predicted entrance length of $0.9*w=0.09 [m]$ matches the experimental approximation of the entrance length discussed in Physics section. As a kind reminder the empirical relation was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L_e = 0.05 * Re_w * D_h ,$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Re_w$ is the Reynolds number of the pipe based on the pipe's width. $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe considering unit depth as defined as $D_h=\\frac{4 . A}{P}$. Here $A$ and $P$ are area and perimeter of the pipe's rectangular inlet. For this simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L_e = 0.05 * 10 * \\frac{4*0.1}{2(1+0.1)} = 0.09 [m]$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the final step for validation one can compare the numerically predicted fully developed velocity profile against the theoretically derived parabolic equation for the velocity profile. To define the theoretical fully developed velocity profile users should use the path of  <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Tools/Field Functions/ [[right click]/New/Scalar</span>, name your variable (i.e. theory_velocity) and put the define formula of $ 1.5 * (1 - pow($${Position}[1]*2 / 0.1 , 2))$, where 1.5 is the maximum centerline velocity and 0.1 is the pipe's width as shown in the previous results (see Fig. 3-2). This will calculate the theoretical fully developed velocity profiles within the CFD domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the final step for validation one can compare the numerically predicted fully developed velocity profile against the theoretically derived equation parabolic velocity profile. To define the theoretical fully developed velocity profile use `define/custom-field-functions/define`, name your variable (i.e. theory_velocity) and put the following formula `1.5 * (1-((2*y-coordinate)/0.1)^2)`. In this formula 1.5 is the maximum centerline velocity as shown in the previous results (see Fig. 2). This will calculate the theoretical fully developed velocity profiles within the CFD domain. Now user can plot the numerically predicted streamwise velocity (X velocity) versus the calculated theoretical velocity at the 0.1w, 0.9w and 50w down stream stations. In order to visualize the numerical versus theoretical velocities along the created line probes user should add a new XY-Plot via <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Plots/ [right click]/New Plot/XY Plot</span> path. Right click on the newly created XY Plot 2 and add the details of the desired plot. It is important to set the previously defined <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Derived Parts</span> under the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Part</span> section of XY-plot 2 and also set <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">X-Type</span> and <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Y-Type</span> of the new plot to the desired scalar of interest. For this step of post-processing set the X-Type to the pre-defined Field Function of velocity[i] and Y-Type to theory_velocity along each probe line. This will result in to the following figure:\n",

    "Fig.4 Comparison between the numerically predicted and theoretically calculated velocity profiles along pre-defined probe-lines along the pipe's length.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Fig.4 the functionality between these two velocities at downstream stations 0.9w and 50w, shown as black and red dots, are linear and the slope of this line is equal to one. This means that both velocity profiles completely match each other. However, within the entrance region this functionality, shown as green dots, is not linear anymore. This highlights the limitation of theoretical calculation to define velocity profile within the entrance length of the pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a practice users are encourage to visualize the full theoretical and numerical velocity profiles to confirm the above-comparison. This can be done via `plot` command. Users first need to store the data at each station down stream to a file and then visualize them on top of each other. Give it a try!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage one can conclude that this CFD numerical simulation is validated to study 2D laminar flow in a rectangular pipe. Therefore, it can be used for similar or more complex problems, such as flow with specified pressure gradient, non-uniform velocity profiles and etc.. This can be done via correct implementation in changing the corresponding boundary conditions."
